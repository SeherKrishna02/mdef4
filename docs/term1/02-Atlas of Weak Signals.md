# Atlas of Weak Signals


**Atlas of weak signals**

The week began with a fun exercise with the atlas of weak signal toolkit. I decided to go forward with the cards I go my through a blind draw as I felt I could make a connection with the 5 cards - 2 weak signals and 3 areas of opportunity and my fight. The cards I deleted from the deck to represent my fight were - circular economy and material development. The area I want to explore is biomaterial. I’m interested in learning to create new materials using waste that is generated during food production and food processing. Focusing on developing new packaging solution that are sustainable while keeping the context in mind.
 Many cultures follow principles of preparation where the whole ingredient is used. While cooking fish, the fillet is grilled and the remaining fish including the bones and tail is used to make a stock. A country like India used ingredients like tamarind, onion, pumpkin and different gourds for many recipes that are generational. The preparation process often results in parts of the vegetable to be discarded. If these could converted to materials that could be used to eat/ pack/ transport the food, this might make the way we consume more circular. The possibilities to work with food waste to create biomaterials is endless.
I have worked on projects around sustainable practices for a community in the past - how to integrate a composting system and community garden into a neighbourhood setting to implement better practices. I had drafted a business plan to tie local cafés into this ecosystem but due to covid this wasn’t put into action.

My weak signal cards were Inter-species Collaboration and Imagining New Jobs, with areas of opportunity like - Supply Chain Innovation, Maker Education and Co-creation. I felt the cards worked well. Future trends talk about collaboration and having diversity and inclusivity. My cards fall into this area collectively. They are extremely inter-connected. Materials for the future talk about biomaterials and converting waste into products that can be utilised in our daily life. I'm extremely excited to be entering a space like this, and design for the possible future.
