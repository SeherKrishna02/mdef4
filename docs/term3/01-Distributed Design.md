# **Distributed Design**

***What is Distributed Design?***

Using global connectivity to move data/ ideas instead of products.

Systems thinking & Design thinking

Surface level to Substance level - breaking down its parts.

EVENT > PATTERN > STRUCTURE > MENTAL MODELS

***Mushroom Model (UNSCHOOL)***

Interconnectivity of things we are connecting.

Outcome

Behaviour pattern

System Structures

Minosets

(interconnected to all natural systems)

Distributive by Design

DIVISIVE (extracting from many places, resources, wealth and passing it on to few people)

DISTRIBUTIVE (extracting  from many places, resources, wealth and passing it on to many people)

A new mushroom model

MAKING = power (using the tools & resources) + knowledge (spores because its replicating) + value (supporting all the things by adding value)

Everything we have, we can distribute these things.

OPEN | COLLABORATE | REGENERATE | EXOSYSTEMIC

open to your ideas being replicated with distributed design

Getting involved with others and letting them be an active member in your design process

Connecting with ancestral wisdom, environmental systems and systems of value

How are you working with other types of communities, non-humans and with communities who have been marginalised.

ACTIVITY 02

Learning Skills

Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?

We were looking up things online so research skills to be able to break the project/ product into parts was very useful.

Dynamics

How was the dynamic inside the group?

It was alright, I would have liked this to be on our individual projects while being collaborate through discussions.

Interactions

Did the role I played influence my opinion?

Nope, the conversations within my group and others was very free-flowing. It helped open up conversations and bring new perspectives & outlooks to the table.

***why would you measure impact?***

Maybe for funding, it's a good communication tool if you can share what your impact will be and why it’s important to them and you.

Social & environmental impact in relation to the distributed design values - how to help designers & creatives to measure the impact of their project in the field.

DAY 02

Learning Skills

Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?

A very important skill for this activity was to be able to look at one’s own work with a very critical eye and be open to suggestions, feedback and discussion.

Dynamics

How was the dynamic inside the group?

It was very interesting as we all had different projects and this played to our strength as well since we could get critique from someone from the outside.

Interactions

Did the role I played influence my opinion?

We were all very open to feedback and since my project scored very high on the Regenerate Environmentally and Regenerate Value, I found myself often giving more suggestions in that field and trying to find some way that the other projects could score higher in those areas.
