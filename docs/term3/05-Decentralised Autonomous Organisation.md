# **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations**

Unfolding the foundation behind big tech

Explore emergent and alternative tech, from narrative, implementation and application point of view.

Provide tools and methods for rapid prototyping of artefacts.

Get familiar with fab lab  mindset, ecosystem and resources.

Design interfaces to abstract technologies - especially when you are talking about digitising interfaces.

A mailman - messenger that then became a fax machine or sending emails.

How radical is it that on the web by default you can select and copy text.

Technologies are cultural artefacts

***Decolonizing Technology  -***

1.  ***from extractive to regenerative technologies***
2. ***from convenience to expression technologies***
3. ***from survival to rebel technologies (duck-duck-go instead of chrome)***

Blockchain is a secure system to store data. It is a public data base and is anonymous but linked to wallets account. It is a software in a way, with updates.

Bitcoin is still ecologically polluting.

Estonia has their own blockchain system. It is the most digitally advanced country.

Every time you save something in the blockchain, depending on which blockchain - the gas fees is different. The number of transactions allowed on the blockchain is still limited.

Conspiracy around the founder of Bitcoin - Satoshi Nakamoto

# Reflection

I'm not sure if I would use the blockchain to store NFTs and if we really need them. If I were to ever use it, I would like to explore the creative aspect and store a series of Nature's Kaleidoscope on it. It is a series of images created by me, and I feel as the ever changing nature of our environment and plants around us can never be replicated exactly the same. Similar to the nature of visuals generated while using a traditional kaleidoscope. My understanding of what can be considered an NFT, by looking at artworks created as NFTs are that they are quite complex and cannot be replicated exactly the same by someone else and that is the reason why people would like to purchase them and own something truly unique and special. I was not able to attend the final presentation but learnt how to set up a Tezos wallet and explored the idea of creating NFTs.
