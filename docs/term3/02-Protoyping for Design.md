# **Prototyping for Design**

# (19 Apr)

Robots - there are many types of robots, even a Roomba is a robot.

Robotic arm

Has much more precision and time saving than a human operators. Increasing the production in less time.

The robotic arm doesn’t have a defined job like a laser cutting, 3d printer or CNC, so it can be tweaked to do many things.

degree of freedom - the number of movable motions in the robot.

work envelope - all the space a robot can reach.

payload - the amount of weight of robot can handle at full arm. extrusion and moving at full speed.

number of axis = number of joineries

3d printer, chain saw, CNC, metal bending, pick & place robot, add a drone, carving, spraying

Types of movements

POLAR

CYLINDRICAL

CARTESIAN

JOINTED ARM

SCARA

2cp - two centre point

coordination - World CS | Robot CS | Base CS | Tool CS

end effector - tool for the robotic arm

Every time you change the tool, you need to calibrate because the TCP changes.

### (20 Apr) **Blender**

The tools that we use, shape us and the things we do.

In digital tools, you let the tools guide you - you feel a sense of freedom and you are the most creative. But otherwise a tool has a defined purpose to do one specific thing.

Free software vs Open Source

Free software - you earlier had the right to sell the code of the software

Open source - you have the licence to use it but you don’t have the right to sell it, there are certain conditions.

Share-alike - if you modify the free software, and choose to distribute it - you are forced to follow the same licence.

G - for moving stuff, it means grab

S - scaling the object
