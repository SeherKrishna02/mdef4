**Design Justice Principles**

**Rethinks design processes, centres people who are normally marginalised by design and uses collaborative creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.**

**Providing active listening, asking about the communities needs, desires, requirements etc. Not approaching the situation being a designer and knowing exactly what design to offer.**

**Principle 01**

*We use design to sustain, heal and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.*

**Principle 02**

*We prioritise design's impact on the community over the intention of the designer.*

**Principle 03**

*We use the rule of the designer as a facilitator rather than the expert.*

**Principle 04**

*We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.*

**Principle 05**

*We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect to the earth and to others.*

**Principle 06**

*We centre the voices of those who are directly impacted by the design process.*

**Principle 07**

*We view change as emergent from an acceptable, accessible and collaborative process rather than a point at the end of the process.*

**Principle 08**

*We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience, and that we all have aligned and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.*

**Principle 09**

*We work towards sustainable, community-led and committed customers.*

**Principle 10**

*Before making new design solutions, we look for what is already working at the community level. We honour and uplift traditional, indigenous and local knowledge and practices.*
