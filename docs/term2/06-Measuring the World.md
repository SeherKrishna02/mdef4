# **Measuring the World**

Data vs. Information

How to convert this data into factual information?

eg. Covid pandemic statistics and the curve.

To turn data into useful information, it must be **analyzed and interpreted** in a way that provides **context and meaning.** This can involve **identifying patterns or trends**, comparing data to benchmarks or industry standards, and using **visualization tools** to help **communicate the information** to others. In the case of Covid pandemic statistics and the curve, this might involve analyzing the data to **identify hotspots or areas of concern**, comparing the data to previous outbreaks or pandemics, and **creating charts or graphs to help illustrate the data** in a way that is easy to understand.

Big tech - when you don’t pay for the product, are you the product?

For example free website and apps, are they tracking more of your information since you’re not directly paying for anything. Instagram, Facebook, reddit, google maps etc - you’re only paying to connect to the server but not actually to the company.

More time you spend on their platform = more data of yours given to them

So they use algorithms to get a higher retention span on their platforms to drain as much information as possible. Eg: you spend way too much time on Instagram and somehow you stuck in a loop and sometimes don’t even realise how long you’ve spent on the platform.

From big data to small data, obtaining human habits from garbage.

- “If the data is not actually anonymous, then you can start figuring out timetables and like some very tactical info, and then you start getting into some pretty serious issues” -  LaFoy
- Is there information more important than our civilian information?

As of 2021, there are over 3,000 commercial satellites in orbit around the Earth.

**Data**

- raw
- disorganised
- no context, just facts
- captured through diff eays
- by different actors

**Information**

**Sense making**

Making tools for data collections that don’t extract data from humans, turning data into information. By humans and for humans. Developing tools and technologies which translate urban environments into tangible data.

**Web scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites using automated software or tools. This involves writing code that can navigate through web pages, locate specific pieces of information, and extract that data into a structured format that can be analyzed or used for other purposes. Web scraping can be used to collect data on products, prices, reviews, and other types of information from e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and other online sources.
