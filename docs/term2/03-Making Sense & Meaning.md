I'd like to share some documentaries that I felt were related to some of the aspects that are discussed in the book - A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things
Book by Jason W. Moore and Raj Patel.


A documentary I recently watched explains the idea of a circular living environment quite well. The Future Food Systems is a project led by Joost Bakker, which aims to demonstrate that we can cultivate and produce food in a more sustainable and waste-free way. Bakker collaborated with FormFlow to construct a building with their unique cladding solution at Federation Square in Melbourne to showcase his vision. The project is highlighted in the Netflix series "Down to Earth with Zac Efron," where viewers can learn more about Bakker's innovative ideas for the future of food production. The ultimate goal of the project is to inspire a new way of thinking about food systems that are not only more sustainable but also more accessible and healthier for everyone.

My journey through this master has been to look at how to make our conenctions with past practices around material development relevant in today's needs for our society. Using the knowledge that was shared with us but somehow lost along the way, how can I adapt it to generate collaboration, co-creation and circularity through it?

I asked ChatGPT to generate answers for the following statements and questions. I was expecting something very technical and a response that I might be unaware of but I feel we have learnt about these through the various modules during the MDEF course and also have learnt through the kind of interests I have(movies and shows)

Upon questioning what was discussed in the book- A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of he Planet is a book by Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore published in 2018. I got this summary from ChatGPT.

<i>A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things is a book that explores the relationship between capitalism and nature, and how it has shaped the world we live in today. The authors, Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore, argue that capitalism has relied on the exploitation of cheap labor, food, energy, raw materials, and finance to expand and accumulate wealth. These cheap things are made possible by the unpaid work of nature and humans, and by externalizing the social and environmental costs of production and consumption.
The book traces the history of capitalism and its impact on nature and society from the colonial era to the present day, focusing on seven cheap things that have enabled capitalism to thrive: nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives. The authors show how these cheap things are interconnected and how they have been used to exploit and dominate people and nature, leading to social and environmental crises such as climate change, inequality, and food insecurity.
The book also offers a critique of mainstream economics and calls for a new approach that recognizes the limits of the planet and the need for ecological and social sustainability. The authors argue that we need to move beyond the logic of cheap things and towards a more just and sustainable economic system that values nature, people, and the common good.</i>
