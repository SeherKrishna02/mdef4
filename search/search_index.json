I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks exploring the culture, streets and cuisine that Barcelona has to offer. After one such day near Sarada Familia, I found myself in a small gelato shop called Madre. A box on the counter caught my attention with print colours and fun patterns. I was intrigued to pick up. I was surprised to realise it was made out of some sort of sustainable material, as one wouldn\u2019t normally buy a tub of ice-cream in a paper box. At the end of the day, I realised that the reason I found this so surprising was because as country like India, we package everything in plastic. There are tons of packaging materials which are not healthy for our environment. My fight is to help generate cleaner ways to package the food we consume. As humans, we continue to generate waste at an increasingly deadly rate. I have always been fond of gardening, cooking and eating. Some of the projects I\u2019ve worked on earlier were along the lines of community practices around sustainability. I believe through this journey of the MDEF program, I will gather the skills and knowledge to be able to create new materials from the this cycle of consumption in terms of food / eating. My fight is to close this loop. Listening to everyone introduce themselves, their work background, what they feel inspired by was a really nice experience. It was great getting a sneak peak into their lives. The visit around Poblenou was extremely insightful. We started the visit with Poblenou Urban District. A company that collaborates and maps out Poblenou to connect companies, collectives and creatives with each-other. We visited Bicilot, whose main focus is to spread the benefit of bicycles for a city, community. They also have a repair workshop where the focus is to learn how to fix your cycle to increase the life of a bicyle. We saw a couple of models of bicyles - used for transport of people, materials etc. Next on the agenda was a guided walk towards Superilla, a couple of residential blocks. The parking space around this area was reclaimed and converted into a public space where people can sit and relax, surrounded by offices, schools, and even a museum! After grabbing some lunch, we made our way to Hangar, a collective for artists, designers and people in the creative field. It exists to provide a space for people to work on their projects, and is open to the public. It is open to artists, writers and designers who are interested in residencies. It houses an extensive collection of tools, labs and spaces for creatives. Our last stop was at Colectivo Bajel, a workshop with artists and designers. It was great getting to see the different projects they were currently working on. The next day I had the opportunity to sit down with my peers and have a one-on-one session with them. The main objective of this was to understand our own skills, knowledge and attitute on a personal & professional level as well as theirs. In order to collaborate with others, one needs to understand what they have to offer and how you can combine yours with them to create a solution and become better change-makers for the future.","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"WHAT\u2019S YOUR FIGHT?

I decided to go forward with the cards I go my through a blind draw as I felt I could make a connection with the 5 cards - 2 weak signals and 3 areas of opportunity and my fight. The cards I deleted from the deck to represent my fight were - circular economy and material development. The area I want to explore is biomaterial. I\u2019m interested in learning to create new materials using waste that is generated during food production and food processing. Focusing on developing new packaging solution that are sustainable while keeping the context in mind. Many cultures follow principles of preparation where the whole ingredient is used. While cooking fish, the fillet is grilled and the remaining fish including the bones and tail is used to make a stock. A country like India used ingredients like tamarind, onion, pumpkin and different gourds for many recipes that are generational. The preparation process often results in parts of the vegetable to be discarded. If these could converted to materials that could be used to eat/ pack/ transport the food, this might make the way we consume more circular. The possibilities to work with food waste to create biomaterials is endless. Varieties of fibers used by Bio-Lutions to create eco-friendly packaging. Credit: Bio-Lutions I have worked on projects around sustainable practices for a community in the past - how to integrate a composting system and community garden into a neighbourhood setting to implement better practices. I had drafted a business plan to tie local caf\u00e9s into this ecosystem but due to covid this wasn\u2019t put into action. My favourite weak signal card from the deck was Carbon Neutral Lifestyle. The selected images depict a sustainable life, one where you are conscious about the planet\u2019s health. Using transport that is carbon neutral or walking, carrying your own bags for grocery shopping, or even using your own water bottle to prevent single use plastic are all steps towards a carbon neutral world. My weak signal cards were Inter-species Collaboration and Imagining New Jobs, with areas of opportunity like - Supply Chain Innovation, Maker Education and Co-creation. I felt the cards worked well. Future trends talk about collaboration and having diversity and inclusivity. My cards fall into this area collectively. They are extremely inter-connected. Materials for the future talk about biomaterials and converting waste into products that can be utilised in our daily life. I\u2019m extremely excited to be entering a space like this, and design for the possible future.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"The week began with a fun exercise with the atlas of weak signal toolkit.

The article titled \u2018Science for food\u2019 talks about how molecular biology contributes to the production and preparation of food. Written by Howard Wolinsky & Kristofor Husted, the article looks at various aspects of GMO, 3D printed food, food production alternatives and altercation that exist and how the role they could play in the near future. In most popular cooking shows and food documentaries like Chef\u2019s Table, Masterchef Australia or others like Salt Fat Heat Acid, you see chefs experimenting with molecular techniques and food chemistry. Heston Blumenthal is a known for his scientific approach towards cooking. Food preparation is going to be influenced and adapt to meet future requirements through the influence of chemistry and biological modifications. The elephant in the room is still going to be, how this can become mainstream and reach the masses. Enzymes like \u2018transglutaminase\u2019 is used by professional chefs to bind different meats together and achieve creative food challenges. While people working in the food service sector might use it to cut costs or increase shelf-life. On one hand, in the supermarket or as a pizza topping, you might not know the quality or composition of the meat you are consuming. High-end restaurants would market their dish and state the method of preparation, there is a certain level of transparency. William Meyers, executive chef at the Stone Harbour Golf Club talks about the advantages of using meat glue. He is able to prepare dishes for diners with delicate digestive systems or those who are gluten intolerant, as the enzyme acts as a binder and replaces the use of flour. He goes on to talk about the chemical tapioca maltodextrin which has has the ability to turn any liquid fat into a powder. By using this powdered fat, chefs are able to enhance complex flavour profiles into the dish while adding a theatrical effect to a dining experience. A common example of this would be a waiter mixing sodium citrate and warm beer to a wheel of aged cheese and achieving a velvety melted cheese effect to pour over a burger or maybe a bowl of pasta. Food producers and especially wine makers are looking for news methods to infuse scientific reactions to tackle climate change, resource depletion, water conservation, reduced soil health, infestation of invasive species. Researchers are looking towards genetically tinkering with micro-organisms to adapt them to meet our demands daily but to quote Howard Wolinsky that \u201c\u2026it is the application of science in agriculture that will enable farmers to feed a world population of 9.5 billion\u201d. The world needs to work towards developing technologies to decrease energy consumption, air and water pollution and wastage of resources in the food production and preparation sector. Our time and money must be re-evaluated in terms of what areas we should be focusing on. Farming and ecological practices should be borrowed from our ancestors and combined with new-age technology to work towards a circular economy. A new world where the the creation of by-products are put back into the system and utilised to feed into another process. This in turn will help fight problems of climate change, resource depletion and infestation of invasive species. A paper on Research Gate titled, Development of an Agricultural Biomaterial Industry in Ontario by Aung Oo, Nafis Muntasir, Kenneth Poon, Alfons Weersink, and Mahendra Thimmanagari talks about food and agricultural in terms of a biomaterial resource for an economy. They have studied and analysed data collected in Ontario and looked at how biofarms for biomass collection have been implemented. The effect on the nation\u2019s economy and where there is a scope to use biomaterials from agriculture biomass in various production lines.

Prototype 01 where the prototype is a means of inquiry was used. In order to create user personas, questionnaires were developed, the needs, wants and desires of individuals were charted out. Analysing the data collected is imperative in design for others. One needs to understand the consumer / end used of the product or system. I have also used Prototype 04, as a vehicle for inquiry. I created a delivery box for cooking ingredients and fresh produce. The aim of creating the prototype was to understand how the components could be packed and delivered without any damage while still being experiential to the consumer upon receiving it. I have used methodolgies like SWOT analysis, vision mission values, user mapping and created drafts for business proposals. I plan to combine Prototype 04 and 01 and experiment with different types of waste to better understand the materials and their characteristics. The bioplastics activity in class helped me begin this journey towards creating new materials. I have identified someone who runs a biomaterials packaging company back in India who can guide me a little with future possibilities in my home country. Paige has offered to conduct a small workshop on creating biomaterials in class, really looking forward to that. The bio lab at Elisava and my class room at Iaac, along with my kitchen in my dorm room will be my local workspace and consists of people who can guide me.
