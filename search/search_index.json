I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks exploring the culture, streets and cuisine that Barcelona has to offer. After one such day near Sarada Familia, I found myself in a small gelato shop called Madre. A box on the counter caught my attention with print colours and fun patterns. I was intrigued to pick up. I was surprised to realise it was made out of some sort of sustainable material, as one wouldn\u2019t normally buy a tub of ice-cream in a paper box. At the end of the day, I realised that the reason I found this so surprising was because as country like India, we package everything in plastic. There are tons of packaging materials which are not healthy for our environment. My fight is to help generate cleaner ways to package the food we consume. As humans, we continue to generate waste at an increasingly deadly rate. I have always been fond of gardening, cooking and eating. Some of the projects I\u2019ve worked on earlier were along the lines of community practices around sustainability. I believe through this journey of the MDEF program, I will gather the skills and knowledge to be able to create new materials from the this cycle of consumption in terms of food / eating. My fight is to close this loop. Listening to everyone introduce themselves, their work background, what they feel inspired by was a really nice experience. It was great getting a sneak peak into their lives. The visit around Poblenou was extremely insightful. We started the visit with Poblenou Urban District. A company that collaborates and maps out Poblenou to connect companies, collectives and creatives with each-other. We visited Bicilot, whose main focus is to spread the benefit of bicycles for a city, community. They also have a repair workshop where the focus is to learn how to fix your cycle to increase the life of a bicyle. We saw a couple of models of bicyles - used for transport of people, materials etc. Next on the agenda was a guided walk towards Superilla, a couple of residential blocks. The parking space around this area was reclaimed and converted into a public space where people can sit and relax, surrounded by offices, schools, and even a museum! After grabbing some lunch, we made our way to Hangar, a collective for artists, designers and people in the creative field. It exists to provide a space for people to work on their projects, and is open to the public. It is open to artists, writers and designers who are interested in residencies. It houses an extensive collection of tools, labs and spaces for creatives. Our last stop was at Colectivo Bajel, a workshop with artists and designers. It was great getting to see the different projects they were currently working on. The next day I had the opportunity to sit down with my peers and have a one-on-one session with them. The main objective of this was to understand our own skills, knowledge and attitute on a personal & professional level as well as theirs. In order to collaborate with others, one needs to understand what they have to offer and how you can combine yours with them to create a solution and become better change-makers for the future.","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"WHAT\u2019S YOUR FIGHT?
