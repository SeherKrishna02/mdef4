I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks exploring the culture, streets and cuisine that Barcelona has to offer. After one such day near Sarada Familia, I found myself in a small gelato shop called Madre.

The article titled \u2018Science for food\u2019 talks about how molecular biology contributes to the production and preparation of food. Written by Howard Wolinsky & Kristofor Husted, the article looks at various aspects of GMO, 3D printed food, food production alternatives and altercation that exist and how the role they could play in the near future. In most popular cooking shows and food documentaries like Chef\u2019s Table, Masterchef Australia or others like Salt Fat Heat Acid, you see chefs experimenting with molecular techniques and food chemistry. Heston Blumenthal is a known for his scientific approach towards cooking. Food preparation is going to be influenced and adapt to meet future requirements through the influence of chemistry and biological modifications. The elephant in the room is still going to be, how this can become mainstream and reach the masses. Enzymes like \u2018transglutaminase\u2019 is used by professional chefs to bind different meats together and achieve creative food challenges. While people working in the food service sector might use it to cut costs or increase shelf-life. On one hand, in the supermarket or as a pizza topping, you might not know the quality or composition of the meat you are consuming. High-end restaurants would market their dish and state the method of preparation, there is a certain level of transparency. William Meyers, executive chef at the Stone Harbour Golf Club talks about the advantages of using meat glue. He is able to prepare dishes for diners with delicate digestive systems or those who are gluten intolerant, as the enzyme acts as a binder and replaces the use of flour. He goes on to talk about the chemical tapioca maltodextrin which has has the ability to turn any liquid fat into a powder. By using this powdered fat, chefs are able to enhance complex flavour profiles into the dish while adding a theatrical effect to a dining experience. A common example of this would be a waiter mixing sodium citrate and warm beer to a wheel of aged cheese and achieving a velvety melted cheese effect to pour over a burger or maybe a bowl of pasta. Food producers and especially wine makers are looking for news methods to infuse scientific reactions to tackle climate change, resource depletion, water conservation, reduced soil health, infestation of invasive species. Researchers are looking towards genetically tinkering with micro-organisms to adapt them to meet our demands daily but to quote Howard Wolinsky that \u201c\u2026it is the application of science in agriculture that will enable farmers to feed a world population of 9.5 billion\u201d. The world needs to work towards developing technologies to decrease energy consumption, air and water pollution and wastage of resources in the food production and preparation sector. Our time and money must be re-evaluated in terms of what areas we should be focusing on. Farming and ecological practices should be borrowed from our ancestors and combined with new-age technology to work towards a circular economy. A new world where the the creation of by-products are put back into the system and utilised to feed into another process. This in turn will help fight problems of climate change, resource depletion and infestation of invasive species. A paper on Research Gate titled, Development of an Agricultural Biomaterial Industry in Ontario by Aung Oo, Nafis Muntasir, Kenneth Poon, Alfons Weersink, and Mahendra Thimmanagari talks about food and agricultural in terms of a biomaterial resource for an economy. They have studied and analysed data collected in Ontario and looked at how biofarms for biomass collection have been implemented. The effect on the nation\u2019s economy and where there is a scope to use biomaterials from agriculture biomass in various production lines. We should look towards other nations that are developing new materials and collaborate and share methodologies on moving towards a highly efficient and self-sufficient way in growing and consuming food.","title":"BioZero"},{"location":"term1/03-BioZero/#bio-zero","text":"","title":"Bio Zero"},{"location":"term1/04-DesignStudio/","text":"Design Studio \u00b6 During my undergrad, I have used various tools for collecting data.

After watching shows like \u2018The Social Dilemma\u2019 and \u2018Black Mirror\u2019, the need for discussing and immersing ourselves in these topics has never been more crucial. The system that connects us also invisibly controls us. By throwing ourselves into opening up devices and gadgets, the fear of being controlled by technology lessened. I have never done something as techie as this before and for me, it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. When we began working as a group to create an almost useless machine, I found that i enjoyed the building part and working with my hands. I began feeling more confident being around the machines in the FabLab. There were some heavy machinery that I was too short to use, but I instead used that opportunity to see how the machine works from up close. According to me, this module was challenging and highly engaging and I felt super proud of my group when we managed to blow our first bubble, using the machine; in-front of our peers and teachers. It was a moment of tension but relief at the same time and we pulled it off by playing off of each other\u2019s strengths. I recently went for a concert by \u00d3lafur Arnalds, this was the first time I was hearing music by this Icelandic artist. It seemed as though certain notes, when played on the different instruments like the piano, cello, violins and drums would trigger parts of the light installation. The stage design seemed like an a breathing, living machine that transported me to various emotions across the performance. This module has helped me in being able to break down larger concepts and identify parts where technology and Arduino may have been used. \u00a9 Sunny Chopda","title":"Techbeyondthemyth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/","text":"Community Engagement \u00b6 Mapping Initial Direction In a sense, my first intervention was during the \u2018Living with your own ideas\u2019 module where I was interested in exploring how cultural cooking practices define our food waste production. This led me towards wanting to work with food waste in the area of generating new materials. Intervention 01 FOOD NOT BOMS by June Bascaran Bilbao Cooking dinner with the \u2018Food not Bombs\u2019 collective helped us look at the waste that is still generated by using left over produce from supermarkets. Noticing how they were spending money on takeaway parcels that were not biodegradable, made us want to explore working with waste even more. Exploration Having only explored creating bioplastics during the short Bio & Agri zero module, I had very little prior knowledge in this area. I felt quite lost as to where to begin, but luckily I had already started collecting my avocado seeds. By seeing what kind of textures other people had achieved using a variety of materials at Materfad, within my group of friends in MDEF ; I was keen to go for it. I had quite a few problems trying to crush the avocado pits in the FabLab but in the process I learnt how to open up the big machine and clean it. I prototyped a cover for the hand-blender in the BioLab to eventually get around the issue. I began the process with following the steps of the recipes I had found online but the variables involved were crazy. My first day of exploration, I placed the materials in the dehydrator to dry but they cracked. The obvious reason was because my recipe largely consisted of H2O. I began feeling a bit more confident after I made a material that seemed to hold its shape. But as the days passed, the material continued to shrink! I decided to experiment with the ratios and all the different materials I had used in the past recipes and create my own. It turned out quite nice as it was the most colourful, multi-textural and I found that I used the most avocado pit material in this one. It was great working along side by group in the BioLab as even though we were doing our own materials, we were very involved in the process of each-others. So I got more out of the exploration experience. I think I would like to work further on materials from kitchen waste but towards creating materials that are more thin, involve older techniques of making materials (less equipment and technology).

Where is the line between a child and a doll, between the animate and the inanimate, in other words, between life and death? - Gaby Wood We discussed the foundational understanding of AI(tools and ethics of it) and machine learning. We explored how one can construct applications to challenge these. Intelligence can be classified under some main categories like- a. Cultural Intelligence (storytelling & community) b. Emotional Intelligence c. Other SYMBOL: innate responses eg. a snake (a cat will interpret a cucumber as a snake) GOAL ORIENTED vs. JUST EXPERIENTIAL Intelligence: Specific functioning, symbol processing, information integration, motor complex skills & languages, etc. How do you define intelligence? SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM (semiotics) how something is - how something connects or corresponds to it. Rational agent - will always choose the options by looking at the information it has, and the state it is in with its intelligence and choose which it can reach the goal faster. \"There is nothing as subjective as data\". How you measure, what you measure is a decision. Cluster - measure of similarity b/w objects Similarity - closer to which side? Centroid - center of a cluster Compulsive Intelligence - AI Confidence Threshold - at what % is it sure of a label. Eg. 80% person | 5% cat I felt as though this module would go over my head but the first few sessions around the theories helped me begin to understand these complex things from the ground-up. Everything was explained really well along with websites and artwork samples which were useful as at times the class felt quite intense. I really enjoyed how creative we got with selecting topics to work with for the AI neural net exercise. It felt very out-of-the-box and we just ran with this idea, and it paid off. We used this opportunity to mock certain companies that tries to sell gimmicky ideas at times. We really stepped into these shoes while making our whole presentation. I really enjoyed looking at all the different ways AI can be used, especially for art installations. Can AI tell us more than that which meets the eye? What if we could map more complex behaviours and interests concepts from a cultural perspective? That go beyond what it can see through images and hear (cause it\u2019s always listening).

Interaction between humans & machines. Prototype - for proof of concept - Arduino board (Feather esp32) Schematic designs How to select a board? Depending on what you want to do, the aspects like power, design etc. - data sheet, pinout, power, how to program, how to setup in Arduino environment and how to install libraries for it. Data size of different computers - K, KB, MB, GB, TB Microcontroller - very small computer, built on a metal oxide board semiconductor circuit chip. Featherboards - produced by Adafruit - is not an Arudiono board in terms of the schematic design of the board. Arduino releases a lot of core which consists of code that makes it easy peasy for us to use it and control things with it. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjYkcPciPT8AhViVeUKHWxUCnoQtwJ6BAhMEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DV4WtPv0yWek&usg=AOvVaw2jlEQQCJfUQF9PDQzRmKvk The Arduino project - freedom to use, understand, modify and share your tools. Open-source information used and modified must be also shared as open-source. Copy-left model of copyright license, eg. Blender, Arduino. Arduino components - the hardware, software and community Open hardware - you can buy a cheap board and use the same design of Arduino but just not use the actual name. Software - offer us a simple interface to talk between the microcontroller and the board. Community - big community with basic and expert level of knowledge people to share ideas and questions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoBUXOOdLXY Things to keep in mind : Power - what kind of power do you need? doe it need to be portable or is it stable? How much power? Can it be powered differently to reduce consumption within the design or use different sources of energy? PoE - Can it use ethernet instead so it get Internet and power at the same time? Input - pins, how many do you need, helps you decide which board to use. does the board have enough of the right kind of pins you need for your project? Network - keep it local unless it really needs to communicate with other devices. How much range do you need? short/ long distance? Cabled or wireless connection? Data/ Processing capabilities - What processing speed do you need? How much RAM, memory do you need? Flash size - how big can your code be which you flash into the board. What kind of data does it need to process? use SBC for audio/video at high speed/resolution. Data storage - do you need to store it on the board? need memory? use a board with SD card compatibility. Usability size - to fit into your project context power - how much power is required to use it user interface - how easy or difficult is it to use it documentation - does it have all the right documentation of how to use it properly? tutorial availability - same as ^ programming interface- you have to check if your board is supported by arduino. Go for C language if you've never coded before. Python demands a lot more storage and doesn\u2019t offer that much control. Debugging - of course check your code but quite often its your cables that are mismatched, loose or not enough voltage( if power is not okay, your device won\u2019t work). Power or heat power - your device should be powered properly, should have enough power or you\u2019ll get a bad reading. heating - if your chip is overheating, it will do crazy things that you won\u2019t be able to understand. serial.print- as much information as you can send to yourself of your device, you should. Functions learned on DAY 01 buzzer / piezo speakertone(), noTone() functions Found it frustrating as I wanted to try out a particular tune but most of the examples online were for the Arduino Uno board, I guess it's because this board is an older board. The feather esp32 microcontroller has more capabilities. So then I decided to try and find a very basic code which I then tried to understand. The circuit was fairly simple to set up and for the code I had to define which pin I would be using on the microcontroller to control the buzzer. After that you just have to Feb 02, 2023 CAM When you transform a design to a language that the manufacturing machines can understand. Rhino is Cad Cura is a CAM Fusion is an all in one tool, CAD, CAM, generative design and beam. CPU vs GPU CPU does big mathematical equations, complex ones, but one by one. GPU is dumb but it has the ability to calculate small operation, large number of them all at the same time. Vector (x2 x y2 = R) no texture Pixel pixels are the smallest unit of bitmap images, which are also called raster images or bitmap. An image with more pixels multiplied by more pixels will be a much larger and sharper image as well. We have the flexibility of using a large pixel image on a larger surface as well as reducing the size, it will remain sharp. Wheres, a lower pixel images cannot be used on a larger surface area, its quality & sharpness will deteriorate considerably. sRGB Resolution More pixels needs more compressor speed so your device then won\u2019t last for so long because you'll have to keep giving your device energy. JPEG file loosing pixels - find readings about it, compresses and de-compresses every time you open the file. PNG - best file sharing format, doesn\u2019t need any compressor. TIFF - multi-layer file format, compressionless, transparent format. x | y | z POINTS - define position of 3d modelling. Mesh / Nurbs - U & V surface space Nurbs - Non-uniform rational B-splines you can connect several of these and create a surface. Easy to modify, smooth surface. You need a powerful CPU Mesh - collection of vertices, edges and faces. You need a good GPU Triangular, Quadrilateral, Hexagonal mesh types 3D scanner is always a mesh file format because it look for these mesh point. You can sketch a model in NURBS and when you need to manufacture it then you translate it to a MESH format. MAP A texture .obj file format for a texture. 3D sculpting Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that allows the expression of parameters and rules that together define, codify and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response. Coding modelling ^ Idea - Login - Design x,y,z,r,h - Five variables you define and can change for parametric modelling. Array - x spacing and y spacing array of 5 lines with specific dimension at each array you place a cube with x,y dimension. Topological Optimisation - mathematical method that optimises material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximising the performance of the system. FEM ( finite element modeling) FEM is an approximation method that subdivides a complex problem space, or domain , into numerous small, simpler pieces (the finite elements) whose behavior can be described with comparatively simple equations. FEM was originally developed for engineering analysis to model and analyze complex systems in mechanical, civil, and aeronautical engineering. It has as its foundation the basic concepts of mechanics, such as Newton\u2019s laws of motion, conservation of mass and energy, equilibrium, and the laws of thermodynamics. An Introduction to Finite Element Modeling Suppose you're an aerospace engineer with a great idea for a new type of jet engine design, but you don't know the sizes, shapes, and materials to use for the parts that will give you maximum power output with minimum fuel consumption, and that won't break under the various thermal and mechanical stresses likely to be seen over all possible operating conditions. https://blog.spatial.com/finite-element-modeling Material Reduction Shortened Design Process Maximum Performance swarm algorithm ant topological behaviour - Marco Dario forces always go to the shortest path. eg. Tokyo subway system Learnings of DAY02 buzzer / piezo speakertone(), noTone() functions We were introduced to a wide range of AI tools for 3d rendering and model making. I have used Adobe dimension and SketchUp in the past for making 3d Models. I have only ever made static 3d models so i'm excited to learn how to animate them using other tools. I have animations on Flash and Adobe Animate before. We were given a task to make music on the Esp32 board and I really wanted to get the super mario tune on it. I found a couple of examples for it on the net but the code was rather complicated for me to understand. I tried using them a couple times but failed. A classmate of mine even asked ChatGPT to give the code for music. I felt it would be more useful for me to try something simple but understand the code completely so here is my very sad attempt at making music. A lot of the examples online were for the Arduino Uno board, maybe because it is an older board.. I think I will get one of those to try out as well. Arduino music G code - we write in G code for the machine | M code - for the actions Robotic arm - x,y,z,a,b,c (6-axis) LASER = Light Application by Stimulated Emission of Radiation - focused photons at a series of frequency through optics. Red - infrared - fast frequency Radio waves - can kill us Ultraviolet - if we lose the ozone layer then the sun will send more UV rays. X-rays - can penetrate through us Gamma rays - nuclear energy produces a lot of these.

I thought about what would be more useful in terms of application for my personal project. As I am interested in working with biomaterials and seeing how i can conduct workshops to teach people how to extend the journey of a material. I thought about what I could make that could be used in a workshop. I feel quite often to feel inspired to make something, you should be able to see and appreciate what you have. This led me to the idea of having a compartmentalised box to store different materials - both waste and ingredients for making biomaterials. An almacen of sorts for making biomaterials. Since these would be 'Materials' of the future, I wanted to write the word 'futura' on it. While lacer cutting, the laser behaved funnily and the text did not get engraved properly. I found this website - Makercase for making different types of boxes. I thought this would make this a little easier as it had the inbuilt kerf option for laser cutting. After a couple of tests on the laser cutter, I had to finally change a lot of the box design on Rhino. At the end, while putting the box together, I still faced issues with the middle panels as there wasn't enough breathing space, I think the slots had to be even more wide. The inspiration for this acrylic box with compartments was so that you can see the various textures, colors and ingredients of the materials and get more inclined to collect waste for making biomaterials. I find that when you can see the quanity and quality of your materials, it makes the whole thing more efficient and lends that level of transparency with your projects as well.. Laser Cutting Learnings of DAY04 buzzer / piezo speakertone(), noTone() functions I found this task extremely difficult as it required me to first understand what and how an LDR works. An LDR is basically a sensor that receives light and can react to it. By connecting a button that signals to obtain the reading from the LDR, to trigger an LED light, I got confused a couple of times. So I decided to start with just connecting the LDR and seeing the reading of it in the serial moniter. Next I took a look at the serial plotter to see how sensitive it was to the light. I decided to cover the whole breadboard with a coffee box to see what difference it would make, I even put my phone torch above it to see how that would affect the LDR reading. I was happy with the progress I was making so I went on to attach an LED to the circuit to see how I could control the LDR reading with an LED and a button. I was able to build this circuit but as the task was to print a dot and a dash, I found it difficult. I wrote the code so that if the reading was above 1000 in the serial moniter, to print a dot or a dash. I decided to add a line which said if this was the reading for more than 50 milliseconds then print a dash \"-\" else print a dot \".\" but i was unable to use the else if statement as I didn't want to print anything if the button is not pressed, although the LDR still has a reading without the button being pressed.
