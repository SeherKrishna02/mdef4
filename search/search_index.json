The article titled \u2018Science for food\u2019 talks about how molecular biology contributes to the production and preparation of food. Written by Howard Wolinsky & Kristofor Husted, the article looks at various aspects of GMO, 3D printed food, food production alternatives and altercation that exist and how the role they could play in the near future. In most popular cooking shows and food documentaries like Chef\u2019s Table, Masterchef Australia or others like Salt Fat Heat Acid, you see chefs experimenting with molecular techniques and food chemistry. Heston Blumenthal is a known for his scientific approach towards cooking. Food preparation is going to be influenced and adapt to meet future requirements through the influence of chemistry and biological modifications. The elephant in the room is still going to be, how this can become mainstream and reach the masses. Enzymes like \u2018transglutaminase\u2019 is used by professional chefs to bind different meats together and achieve creative food challenges. While people working in the food service sector might use it to cut costs or increase shelf-life. On one hand, in the supermarket or as a pizza topping, you might not know the quality or composition of the meat you are consuming. High-end restaurants would market their dish and state the method of preparation, there is a certain level of transparency. William Meyers, executive chef at the Stone Harbour Golf Club talks about the advantages of using meat glue. He is able to prepare dishes for diners with delicate digestive systems or those who are gluten intolerant, as the enzyme acts as a binder and replaces the use of flour. He goes on to talk about the chemical tapioca maltodextrin which has has the ability to turn any liquid fat into a powder. By using this powdered fat, chefs are able to enhance complex flavour profiles into the dish while adding a theatrical effect to a dining experience. A common example of this would be a waiter mixing sodium citrate and warm beer to a wheel of aged cheese and achieving a velvety melted cheese effect to pour over a burger or maybe a bowl of pasta. Food producers and especially wine makers are looking for news methods to infuse scientific reactions to tackle climate change, resource depletion, water conservation, reduced soil health, infestation of invasive species. Researchers are looking towards genetically tinkering with micro-organisms to adapt them to meet our demands daily but to quote Howard Wolinsky that \u201c\u2026it is the application of science in agriculture that will enable farmers to feed a world population of 9.5 billion\u201d. The world needs to work towards developing technologies to decrease energy consumption, air and water pollution and wastage of resources in the food production and preparation sector. Our time and money must be re-evaluated in terms of what areas we should be focusing on. Farming and ecological practices should be borrowed from our ancestors and combined with new-age technology to work towards a circular economy. A new world where the the creation of by-products are put back into the system and utilised to feed into another process. This in turn will help fight problems of climate change, resource depletion and infestation of invasive species. A paper on Research Gate titled, Development of an Agricultural Biomaterial Industry in Ontario by Aung Oo, Nafis Muntasir, Kenneth Poon, Alfons Weersink, and Mahendra Thimmanagari talks about food and agricultural in terms of a biomaterial resource for an economy. They have studied and analysed data collected in Ontario and looked at how biofarms for biomass collection have been implemented. The effect on the nation\u2019s economy and where there is a scope to use biomaterials from agriculture biomass in various production lines. We should look towards other nations that are developing new materials and collaborate and share methodologies on moving towards a highly efficient and self-sufficient way in growing and consuming food.","title":"BioZero"},{"location":"term1/03-BioZero/#bio-zero","text":"","title":"Bio Zero"},{"location":"term1/04-DesignStudio/","text":"Design Studio \u00b6 During my undergrad, I have used various tools for collecting data.

After watching shows like \u2018The Social Dilemma\u2019 and \u2018Black Mirror\u2019, the need for discussing and immersing ourselves in these topics has never been more crucial. The system that connects us also invisibly controls us. By throwing ourselves into opening up devices and gadgets, the fear of being controlled by technology lessened. I have never done something as techie as this before and for me, it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. When we began working as a group to create an almost useless machine, I found that i enjoyed the building part and working with my hands. I began feeling more confident being around the machines in the FabLab. There were some heavy machinery that I was too short to use, but I instead used that opportunity to see how the machine works from up close. According to me, this module was challenging and highly engaging and I felt super proud of my group when we managed to blow our first bubble, using the machine; in-front of our peers and teachers. It was a moment of tension but relief at the same time and we pulled it off by playing off of each other\u2019s strengths. I recently went for a concert by \u00d3lafur Arnalds, this was the first time I was hearing music by this Icelandic artist. It seemed as though certain notes, when played on the different instruments like the piano, cello, violins and drums would trigger parts of the light installation. The stage design seemed like an a breathing, living machine that transported me to various emotions across the performance. This module has helped me in being able to break down larger concepts and identify parts where technology and Arduino may have been used. \u00a9 Sunny Chopda","title":"Techbeyondthemyth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/","text":"Community Engagement \u00b6 Mapping Initial Direction In a sense, my first intervention was during the \u2018Living with your own ideas\u2019 module where I was interested in exploring how cultural cooking practices define our food waste production. This led me towards wanting to work with food waste in the area of generating new materials. Intervention 01 FOOD NOT BOMS by June Bascaran Bilbao Cooking dinner with the \u2018Food not Bombs\u2019 collective helped us look at the waste that is still generated by using left over produce from supermarkets. Noticing how they were spending money on takeaway parcels that were not biodegradable, made us want to explore working with waste even more. Exploration Having only explored creating bioplastics during the short Bio & Agri zero module, I had very little prior knowledge in this area. I felt quite lost as to where to begin, but luckily I had already started collecting my avocado seeds. By seeing what kind of textures other people had achieved using a variety of materials at Materfad, within my group of friends in MDEF ; I was keen to go for it. I had quite a few problems trying to crush the avocado pits in the FabLab but in the process I learnt how to open up the big machine and clean it. I prototyped a cover for the hand-blender in the BioLab to eventually get around the issue. I began the process with following the steps of the recipes I had found online but the variables involved were crazy. My first day of exploration, I placed the materials in the dehydrator to dry but they cracked. The obvious reason was because my recipe largely consisted of H2O. I began feeling a bit more confident after I made a material that seemed to hold its shape. But as the days passed, the material continued to shrink! I decided to experiment with the ratios and all the different materials I had used in the past recipes and create my own. It turned out quite nice as it was the most colourful, multi-textural and I found that I used the most avocado pit material in this one. It was great working along side by group in the BioLab as even though we were doing our own materials, we were very involved in the process of each-others. So I got more out of the exploration experience. I think I would like to work further on materials from kitchen waste but towards creating materials that are more thin, involve older techniques of making materials (less equipment and technology).

We explored how one can construct applications to challenge these. Intelligence can be classified under some main categories like- a. Cultural Intelligence (storytelling & community) b. Emotional Intelligence c.

Everything was explained really well along with websites and artwork samples which were useful as at times the class felt quite intense. I really enjoyed how creative we got with selecting topics to work with for the AI neural net exercise. It felt very out-of-the-box and we just ran with this idea, and it paid off. We used this opportunity to mock certain companies that tries to sell gimmicky ideas at times. We really stepped into these shoes while making our whole presentation. I really enjoyed looking at all the different ways AI can be used, especially for art installations. Can AI tell us more than that which meets the eye? What if we could map more complex behaviours and interests concepts from a cultural perspective? That go beyond what it can see through images and hear (cause it\u2019s always listening).

I\u2019d like to share some documentaries that I felt were related to some of the aspects that are discussed in the book - A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things Book by Jason W. Moore and Raj Patel. A documentary I recently watched explains the idea of a circular living environment quite well. The Future Food Systems is a project led by Joost Bakker, which aims to demonstrate that we can cultivate and produce food in a more sustainable and waste-free way. Bakker collaborated with FormFlow to construct a building with their unique cladding solution at Federation Square in Melbourne to showcase his vision. The project is highlighted in the Netflix series \u201cDown to Earth with Zac Efron,\u201d where viewers can learn more about Bakker\u2019s innovative ideas for the future of food production. The ultimate goal of the project is to inspire a new way of thinking about food systems that are not only more sustainable but also more accessible and healthier for everyone. Seaspiracy\u201d is a documentary film on Netflix that explores the impact of human activity on the world\u2019s oceans, highlighting issues such as overfishing, plastic pollution, and the damaging effects of industrial fishing practices. The film exposes some of the darker aspects of the fishing industry and challenges commonly held beliefs about sustainable fishing practices. The documentary has generated controversy but has succeeded in raising awareness about important environmental issues. My journey through this master has been to look at how to make our conenctions with past practices around material development relevant in today\u2019s needs for our society. Using the knowledge that was shared with us but somehow lost along the way, how can I adapt it to generate collaboration, co-creation and circularity through it? I asked ChatGPT to generate answers for the following statements and questions. I was expecting something very technical and a response that I might be unaware of but I feel we have learnt about these through the various modules during the MDEF course and also have learnt through the kind of interests I have(movies and shows) Upon questioning what was discussed in the book- A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of he Planet is a book by Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore published in 2018. I got this summary from ChatGPT. A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things is a book that explores the relationship between capitalism and nature, and how it has shaped the world we live in today. The authors, Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore, argue that capitalism has relied on the exploitation of cheap labor, food, energy, raw materials, and finance to expand and accumulate wealth. These cheap things are made possible by the unpaid work of nature and humans, and by externalizing the social and environmental costs of production and consumption. The book traces the history of capitalism and its impact on nature and society from the colonial era to the present day, focusing on seven cheap things that have enabled capitalism to thrive: nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives. The authors show how these cheap things are interconnected and how they have been used to exploit and dominate people and nature, leading to social and environmental crises such as climate change, inequality, and food insecurity. The book also offers a critique of mainstream economics and calls for a new approach that recognizes the limits of the planet and the need for ecological and social sustainability. The authors argue that we need to move beyond the logic of cheap things and towards a more just and sustainable economic system that values nature, people, and the common good. How can design help with what this book talks about? Design can play an important role in addressing the issues raised in the book \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d by Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore. Here are some ways in which design can contribute: Sustainable Design: Designers can create products, services, and systems that minimize their impact on the environment and reduce the use of cheap natural resources, such as water, energy, and raw materials. Sustainable design can also address the social impacts of production, such as labor conditions, by promoting fair trade and ethical practices.

The documentary has generated controversy but has succeeded in raising awareness about important environmental issues. My journey through this master has been to look at how to make our conenctions with past practices around material development relevant in today\u2019s needs for our society. Using the knowledge that was shared with us but somehow lost along the way, how can I adapt it to generate collaboration, co-creation and circularity through it? I asked ChatGPT to generate answers for the following statements and questions. I was expecting something very technical and a response that I might be unaware of but I feel we have learnt about these through the various modules during the MDEF course and also have learnt through the kind of interests I have(movies and shows) Upon questioning what was discussed in the book- A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of he Planet is a book by Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore published in 2018. I got this summary from ChatGPT. A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things is a book that explores the relationship between capitalism and nature, and how it has shaped the world we live in today. The authors, Raj Patel and Jason W. Moore, argue that capitalism has relied on the exploitation of cheap labor, food, energy, raw materials, and finance to expand and accumulate wealth. These cheap things are made possible by the unpaid work of nature and humans, and by externalizing the social and environmental costs of production and consumption. The book traces the history of capitalism and its impact on nature and society from the colonial era to the present day, focusing on seven cheap things that have enabled capitalism to thrive: nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives. The authors show how these cheap things are interconnected and how they have been used to exploit and dominate people and nature, leading to social and environmental crises such as climate change, inequality, and food insecurity. The book also offers a critique of mainstream economics and calls for a new approach that recognizes the limits of the planet and the need for ecological and social sustainability. The authors argue that we need to move beyond the logic of cheap things and towards a more just and sustainable economic system that values nature, people, and the common good.

By creating complex geometry within the object, you can save more material and time. SHELL - top layer, bottom layer, shell and infill INFILL - to fill density, 50% infill is stronger. Most printer\u2019s use 20% infill. more infill + additional thickness of the casing provides strength (can be driller) Types of Infill- rectangular / triangular / wiggle / honeycomb You can change the shape properties using different infill patterns. Eg. a wiggle infill pattern can be springy/ flexible. STL - mesh file for 3D printing OBJ is the best - has scale also. Paste printing - the consistency can be worked on by additives to make them cure faster and also reduce the material properties.

Networking & Communication communication - free flowing data/ electricity/ energy from one point to another internet - read the sensor to send data by reading the values and sending it to the network. network - a set of devices connected to each other through any type of communication lines that allows the exchange of data between them. why do we want networks? to give information to someone who is not in the same place. Communication protocols - The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. air / ears / mouth are the physical parts that let the data flow. but when you speak in another language, the data doesn\u2019t flow cause you don\u2019t understand. So you need a set of rules/ protocols to define how data is going to flow. Depending on the different networks, there are different protocols. Gateway - star network topology DNS - Domain Name System - the part before .com / .edu / .org Gemini is a new internet protocol that aims to be simple, fast, and efficient. It was created as an alternative to HTTP and HTTPS, which are more complex and slow due to their many features and security measures. Gemini is designed to be easy to implement and use for both clients and servers. It uses a simple text-based format for requests and responses, and supports basic HTML-like formatting for text content. Asynchronised communication - serial.begin function there is no timing constraint. Synchronised communication - eg; a beating drum for synchronised rowing of a boat. there is a time constraint.

AUTOMATION ACCURATE kerf cutting style - the laser goes on the line, it cuts a half on one side and half on the other so the dimension of the object will change. But if you choose the option \u2018cut outside of the line\u2019 then you get the interior part of the dimension. tolerance dog bone / T-bone cuts so the pieces fit together really well. TOOLPATH which order, what speed to cut which part in 6mm end mill will cut max. 3mm fabricate in pairs or more make a pice of furniture for the class or something for your intervention\u2019 add 0.4mm + thickness of material for the cut depth to be sure the material is cutting cut all the way through. 3D Printing Learning of Challenge 02 I had already planned to continue to work on the same artefact from challenge 01. We worked together on improving the pen holder with a new gasket/washer so it would grip the tool better. We wanted to prevent it from moving upwards and downwards while rotating but wanted it to make sideways to carve more smoothly and precisely. Making the molds for the cups was really fun. It was the first time I had made something like this. We had a few challenges with removing our plaster from the 3d printed mold has we had some sharp corners. It would have been better to make a 3-part mold instead of what we made. In the end, we ended up destroying the 3d printed mold which was a shame but it had to be done. Overall, we made a lot of progress during this week. We improved the coding so the spinning table movement could be customised and controlled with a knob,we could also alternate the direction of it. We still need to work on preventing the pause of the carving tool while the table spins..We will do this during the next round. Our design of the artefact has developed considerably, it is now a perfect conbination of a phonograph and spinning table with a carving tool!

Interaction between humans & machines. Prototype - for proof of concept - Arduino board (Feather esp32) Schematic designs How to select a board? Depending on what you want to do, the aspects like power, design etc. data sheet, pinout, power, how to program, how to setup in Arduino environment and how to install libraries for it. Data size of different computers - K, KB, MB, GB, TB Microcontroller - very small computer, built on a metal oxide board semiconductor circuit chip. Featherboards - produced by Adafruit - is not an Arudiono board in terms of the schematic design of the board. Arduino releases a lot of core which consists of code that makes it easy peasy for us to use it and control things with it. The Arduino project - freedom to use, understand, modify and share your tools. Open-source information used and modified must be also shared as open-source. Copy-left model of copyright license, eg. Blender, Arduino. Arduino components - the hardware, software and community Open hardware - you can buy a cheap board and use the same design of Arduino but just not use the actual name. Software - offer us a simple interface to talk between the microcontroller and the board. Community - big community with basic and expert level of knowledge people to share ideas and questions. Things to keep in mind : Power - what kind of power do you need? doe it need to be portable or is it stable? How much power? Can it be powered differently to reduce consumption within the design or use different sources of energy? PoE - Can it use ethernet instead so it get Internet and power at the same time? Input - pins, how many do you need, helps you decide which board to use. does the board have enough of the right kind of pins you need for your project? Network - keep it local unless it really needs to communicate with other devices. How much range do you need? short/ long distance? Cabled or wireless connection? Data/ Processing capabilities - What processing speed do you need? How much RAM, memory do you need? Flash size - how big can your code be which you flash into the board. What kind of data does it need to process? use SBC for audio/video at high speed/resolution. Data storage - do you need to store it on the board? need memory? use a board with SD card compatibility. Usability size - to fit into your project context power - how much power is required to use it user interface - how easy or difficult is it to use it documentation - does it have all the right documentation of how to use it properly? tutorial availability - same as ^ programming interface- you have to check if your board is supported by arduino. Go for C language if you\u2019ve never coded before. Python demands a lot more storage and doesn\u2019t offer that much control. Debugging - of course check your code but quite often its your cables that are mismatched, loose or not enough voltage( if power is not okay, your device won\u2019t work). Power or heat power - your device should be powered properly, should have enough power or you\u2019ll get a bad reading. heating - if your chip is overheating, it will do crazy things that you won\u2019t be able to understand. serial.print- as much information as you can send to yourself of your device, you should. Functions learned on DAY 01 buzzer / piezo speakertone(), noTone() functions Found it frustrating as I wanted to try out a particular tune but most of the examples online were for the Arduino Uno board, I guess it\u2019s because this board is an older board. The feather esp32 microcontroller has more capabilities. So then I decided to try and find a very basic code which I then tried to understand. The circuit was fairly simple to set up and for the code I had to define which pin I would be using on the microcontroller to control the buzzer. After that you just have to Feb 02, 2023 CAM When you transform a design to a language that the manufacturing machines can understand. Rhino is Cad Cura is a CAM Fusion is an all in one tool, CAD, CAM, generative design and beam. CPU vs GPU CPU does big mathematical equations, complex ones, but one by one. GPU is dumb but it has the ability to calculate small operation, large number of them all at the same time. Vector (x2 x y2 = R) no texture Pixel pixels are the smallest unit of bitmap images, which are also called raster images or bitmap. An image with more pixels multiplied by more pixels will be a much larger and sharper image as well. We have the flexibility of using a large pixel image on a larger surface as well as reducing the size, it will remain sharp. Wheres, a lower pixel images cannot be used on a larger surface area, its quality & sharpness will deteriorate considerably. sRGB Resolution More pixels needs more compressor speed so your device then won\u2019t last for so long because you\u2019ll have to keep giving your device energy. JPEG file loosing pixels - find readings about it, compresses and de-compresses every time you open the file. PNG - best file sharing format, doesn\u2019t need any compressor. TIFF - multi-layer file format, compressionless, transparent format. x | y | z POINTS - define position of 3d modelling. Mesh / Nurbs - U & V surface space Nurbs - Non-uniform rational B-splines you can connect several of these and create a surface. Easy to modify, smooth surface. You need a powerful CPU Mesh - collection of vertices, edges and faces. You need a good GPU Triangular, Quadrilateral, Hexagonal mesh types 3D scanner is always a mesh file format because it look for these mesh point. You can sketch a model in NURBS and when you need to manufacture it then you translate it to a MESH format. MAP A texture .obj file format for a texture. 3D sculpting Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that allows the expression of parameters and rules that together define, codify and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response. Coding modelling ^ Idea - Login - Design x,y,z,r,h - Five variables you define and can change for parametric modelling. Array - x spacing and y spacing array of 5 lines with specific dimension at each array you place a cube with x,y dimension. Topological Optimisation - mathematical method that optimises material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximising the performance of the system. FEM ( finite element modeling) FEM is an approximation method that subdivides a complex problem space, or domain , into numerous small, simpler pieces (the finite elements) whose behavior can be described with comparatively simple equations. FEM was originally developed for engineering analysis to model and analyze complex systems in mechanical, civil, and aeronautical engineering. It has as its foundation the basic concepts of mechanics, such as Newton\u2019s laws of motion, conservation of mass and energy, equilibrium, and the laws of thermodynamics. An Introduction to Finite Element Modeling Material Reduction Shortened Design Process Maximum Performance swarm algorithm ant topological behaviour - Marco Dario forces always go to the shortest path. eg. Tokyo subway system G code - we write in G code for the machine | M code - for the actions Robotic arm - x,y,z,a,b,c (6-axis) LASER Light Application by Stimulated Emission of Radiation - focused photons at a series of frequency through optics. Red - infrared - fast frequency Radio waves - can kill us Ultraviolet - if we lose the ozone layer then the sun will send more UV rays. X-rays - can penetrate through us Gamma rays - nuclear energy produces a lot of these.

Reflection on Robots \u00b6 In this session, we began our exploration of modern robot arms. We learned about the different types of robot arms currently in use, including their motor systems and the number of axes they possess. We also discussed the various end effectors that can be attached to these arms, expanding their functionality. We looked at practical techniques and applications commonly associated with robotic arms, such as 3D printing, milling, cutting, and automation. These processes play a significant role in harnessing the capabilities of robotic arms. We were then introduced to one of the IAAC robotic arms, this class was dedicated to understanding how to prepare robotic arm files using Grasshopper. Through this software, we discovered how to simulate movements and manipulate parameters using scripts. This allowed us to gain a better understanding of the control and modification possibilities within robotic arm design. The session ended with a hands-on activity. we utilized the robotic arm to print the letters \u201cMDEF.\u201d This helped us to showcase what we had learned and further reinforced our understanding of working with robotic arms.

Free software vs Open Source Free software - you earlier had the right to sell the code of the software Open source - you have the licence to use it but you don\u2019t have the right to sell it, there are certain conditions. Share-alike - if you modify the free software, and choose to distribute it - you are forced to follow the same licence. G - for moving stuff, it means grab S - scaling the object Reflection on Blender \u00b6 After getting the basics in the last blender session, we were introduced to python in blender. Python is a progammimg language that can also be used as a way to design in Blender. We tried some basic tools in blender using python such as array: We then connected a Led strip light and connected it to blender where with the movement of the mouse as a sensor, the led lights blinked and moved in the same direction. It was interesting to see how you can see the interfaces interact to explore electronics. LED lights + Blender I enjoyed trying the open source modelling softwares a lot.

The session ended with a hands-on activity. we utilized the robotic arm to print the letters \u201cMDEF.\u201d This helped us to showcase what we had learned and further reinforced our understanding of working with robotic arms.","title":"Reflection on Robots"},{"location":"term3/02-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#20-apr-blender","text":"The tools that we use, shape us and the things we do.

We tried some basic tools in blender using python such as array: We then connected a Led strip light and connected it to blender where with the movement of the mouse as a sensor, the led lights blinked and moved in the same direction. It was interesting to see how you can see the interfaces interact to explore electronics. LED lights + Blender I enjoyed trying the open source modelling softwares a lot.
