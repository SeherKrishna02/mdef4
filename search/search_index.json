As a designer, I am inclined towards projects that focus on brand identity, service design, and user research. During my free time, I spend it trying out new recipes, taking care of my plants, and occasionally, I play the piano. I have a B.Des(Communication Design) from Kingston University, London after studying at IIAD, New Delhi. After working for 2 years in the service sector for a cheese company where I wore many hats (graphic designer + social media marketing + packaging + branding + product photography), I worked for a signage and way-finding design firm. I felt like i wasn\u2019t up-skilling after a point and my work didn\u2019t challenge me as much, I found this master\u2019s course at IaaC that seemed like just what I needed! I\u2019m very pumped to be here and can\u2019t wait to see where this year takes me. \u263a Emergent Futures","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about","text":"Hello there!

I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks exploring the culture, streets and cuisine that Barcelona has to offer. After one such day near Sarada Familia, I found myself in a small gelato shop called Madre. A box on the counter caught my attention with print colours and fun patterns. I was intrigued to pick up. I was surprised to realise it was made out of some sort of sustainable material, as one wouldn\u2019t normally buy a tub of ice-cream in a paper box. At the end of the day, I realised that the reason I found this so surprising was because as country like India, we package everything in plastic. There are tons of packaging materials which are not healthy for our environment. My fight is to help generate cleaner ways to package the food we consume. As humans, we continue to generate waste at an increasingly deadly rate. I have always been fond of gardening, cooking and eating. Some of the projects I\u2019ve worked on earlier were along the lines of community practices around sustainability. I believe through this journey of the MDEF program, I will gather the skills and knowledge to be able to create new materials from the this cycle of consumption in terms of food / eating. My fight is to close this loop. Listening to everyone introduce themselves, their work background, what they feel inspired by was a really nice experience. It was great getting a sneak peak into their lives. The visit around Poblenou was extremely insightful. We started the visit with Poblenou Urban District. A company that collaborates and maps out Poblenou to connect companies, collectives and creatives with each-other. We visited Bicilot, whose main focus is to spread the benefit of bicycles for a city, community. They also have a repair workshop where the focus is to learn how to fix your cycle to increase the life of a bicyle. We saw a couple of models of bicyles - used for transport of people, materials etc. Next on the agenda was a guided walk towards Superilla, a couple of residential blocks. The parking space around this area was reclaimed and converted into a public space where people can sit and relax, surrounded by offices, schools, and even a museum! After grabbing some lunch, we made our way to Hangar, a collective for artists, designers and people in the creative field. It exists to provide a space for people to work on their projects, and is open to the public. It is open to artists, writers and designers who are interested in residencies. It houses an extensive collection of tools, labs and spaces for creatives. Our last stop was at Colectivo Bajel, a workshop with artists and designers. It was great getting to see the different projects they were currently working on. The next day I had the opportunity to sit down with my peers and have a one-on-one session with them. The main objective of this was to understand our own skills, knowledge and attitute on a personal & professional level as well as theirs. In order to collaborate with others, one needs to understand what they have to offer and how you can combine yours with them to create a solution and become better change-makers for the future.","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"WHAT\u2019S YOUR FIGHT?

I decided to go forward with the cards I go my through a blind draw as I felt I could make a connection with the 5 cards - 2 weak signals and 3 areas of opportunity and my fight. The cards I deleted from the deck to represent my fight were - circular economy and material development. The area I want to explore is biomaterial. I\u2019m interested in learning to create new materials using waste that is generated during food production and food processing. Focusing on developing new packaging solution that are sustainable while keeping the context in mind. Many cultures follow principles of preparation where the whole ingredient is used. While cooking fish, the fillet is grilled and the remaining fish including the bones and tail is used to make a stock. A country like India used ingredients like tamarind, onion, pumpkin and different gourds for many recipes that are generational. The preparation process often results in parts of the vegetable to be discarded. If these could converted to materials that could be used to eat/ pack/ transport the food, this might make the way we consume more circular. The possibilities to work with food waste to create biomaterials is endless. I have worked on projects around sustainable practices for a community in the past - how to integrate a composting system and community garden into a neighbourhood setting to implement better practices. I had drafted a business plan to tie local caf\u00e9s into this ecosystem but due to covid this wasn\u2019t put into action. My weak signal cards were Inter-species Collaboration and Imagining New Jobs, with areas of opportunity like - Supply Chain Innovation, Maker Education and Co-creation. I felt the cards worked well. Future trends talk about collaboration and having diversity and inclusivity. My cards fall into this area collectively. They are extremely inter-connected. Materials for the future talk about biomaterials and converting waste into products that can be utilised in our daily life. I\u2019m extremely excited to be entering a space like this, and design for the possible future.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"The week began with a fun exercise with the atlas of weak signal toolkit.
