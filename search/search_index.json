I\u2019ve spent the last few weeks exploring the culture, streets and cuisine that Barcelona has to offer. After one such day near Sarada Familia, I found myself in a small gelato shop called Madre.

I was surprised to realise it was made out of some sort of sustainable material, as one wouldn\u2019t normally buy a tub of ice-cream in a paper box. At the end of the day, I realised that the reason I found this so surprising was because as country like India, we package everything in plastic. There are tons of packaging materials which are not healthy for our environment. My fight is to help generate cleaner ways to package the food we consume. As humans, we continue to generate waste at an increasingly deadly rate. I have always been fond of gardening, cooking and eating.

The article titled \u2018Science for food\u2019 talks about how molecular biology contributes to the production and preparation of food. Written by Howard Wolinsky & Kristofor Husted, the article looks at various aspects of GMO, 3D printed food, food production alternatives and altercation that exist and how the role they could play in the near future. In most popular cooking shows and food documentaries like Chef\u2019s Table, Masterchef Australia or others like Salt Fat Heat Acid, you see chefs experimenting with molecular techniques and food chemistry. Heston Blumenthal is a known for his scientific approach towards cooking. Food preparation is going to be influenced and adapt to meet future requirements through the influence of chemistry and biological modifications. The elephant in the room is still going to be, how this can become mainstream and reach the masses. Enzymes like \u2018transglutaminase\u2019 is used by professional chefs to bind different meats together and achieve creative food challenges. While people working in the food service sector might use it to cut costs or increase shelf-life. On one hand, in the supermarket or as a pizza topping, you might not know the quality or composition of the meat you are consuming. High-end restaurants would market their dish and state the method of preparation, there is a certain level of transparency. William Meyers, executive chef at the Stone Harbour Golf Club talks about the advantages of using meat glue. He is able to prepare dishes for diners with delicate digestive systems or those who are gluten intolerant, as the enzyme acts as a binder and replaces the use of flour. He goes on to talk about the chemical tapioca maltodextrin which has has the ability to turn any liquid fat into a powder. By using this powdered fat, chefs are able to enhance complex flavour profiles into the dish while adding a theatrical effect to a dining experience. A common example of this would be a waiter mixing sodium citrate and warm beer to a wheel of aged cheese and achieving a velvety melted cheese effect to pour over a burger or maybe a bowl of pasta. Food producers and especially wine makers are looking for news methods to infuse scientific reactions to tackle climate change, resource depletion, water conservation, reduced soil health, infestation of invasive species. Researchers are looking towards genetically tinkering with micro-organisms to adapt them to meet our demands daily but to quote Howard Wolinsky that \u201c\u2026it is the application of science in agriculture that will enable farmers to feed a world population of 9.5 billion\u201d. The world needs to work towards developing technologies to decrease energy consumption, air and water pollution and wastage of resources in the food production and preparation sector. Our time and money must be re-evaluated in terms of what areas we should be focusing on. Farming and ecological practices should be borrowed from our ancestors and combined with new-age technology to work towards a circular economy. A new world where the the creation of by-products are put back into the system and utilised to feed into another process. This in turn will help fight problems of climate change, resource depletion and infestation of invasive species. A paper on Research Gate titled, Development of an Agricultural Biomaterial Industry in Ontario by Aung Oo, Nafis Muntasir, Kenneth Poon, Alfons Weersink, and Mahendra Thimmanagari talks about food and agricultural in terms of a biomaterial resource for an economy. They have studied and analysed data collected in Ontario and looked at how biofarms for biomass collection have been implemented. The effect on the nation\u2019s economy and where there is a scope to use biomaterials from agriculture biomass in various production lines. We should look towards other nations that are developing new materials and collaborate and share methodologies on moving towards a highly efficient and self-sufficient way in growing and consuming food.","title":"BioZero"},{"location":"term1/03-BioZero/#bio-zero","text":"","title":"Bio Zero"},{"location":"term1/04-DesignStudio/","text":"Design Studio \u00b6 During my undergrad, I have used various tools for collecting data.

After watching shows like \u2018The Social Dilemma\u2019 and \u2018Black Mirror\u2019, the need for discussing and immersing ourselves in these topics has never been more crucial. The system that connects us also invisibly controls us. By throwing ourselves into opening up devices and gadgets, the fear of being controlled by technology lessened. I have never done something as techie as this before and for me, it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. When we began working as a group to create an almost useless machine, I found that i enjoyed the building part and working with my hands. I began feeling more confident being around the machines in the FabLab. There were some heavy machinery that I was too short to use, but I instead used that opportunity to see how the machine works from up close. According to me, this module was challenging and highly engaging and I felt super proud of my group when we managed to blow our first bubble, using the machine; in-front of our peers and teachers. It was a moment of tension but relief at the same time and we pulled it off by playing off of each other\u2019s strengths. I recently went for a concert by \u00d3lafur Arnalds, this was the first time I was hearing music by this Icelandic artist. It seemed as though certain notes, when played on the different instruments like the piano, cello, violins and drums would trigger parts of the light installation. The stage design seemed like an a breathing, living machine that transported me to various emotions across the performance. This module has helped me in being able to break down larger concepts and identify parts where technology and Arduino may have been used. \u00a9 Sunny Chopda","title":"Techbeyondthemyth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/","text":"Community Engagement \u00b6 Mapping Initial Direction In a sense, my first intervention was during the \u2018Living with your own ideas\u2019 module where I was interested in exploring how cultural cooking practices define our food waste production. This led me towards wanting to work with food waste in the area of generating new materials. Intervention 01 FOOD NOT BOMS by June Bascaran Bilbao Cooking dinner with the \u2018Food not Bombs\u2019 collective helped us look at the waste that is still generated by using left over produce from supermarkets. Noticing how they were spending money on takeaway parcels that were not biodegradable, made us want to explore working with waste even more. Exploration Having only explored creating bioplastics during the short Bio & Agri zero module, I had very little prior knowledge in this area. I felt quite lost as to where to begin, but luckily I had already started collecting my avocado seeds. By seeing what kind of textures other people had achieved using a variety of materials at Materfad, within my group of friends in MDEF ; I was keen to go for it. I had quite a few problems trying to crush the avocado pits in the FabLab but in the process I learnt how to open up the big machine and clean it. I prototyped a cover for the hand-blender in the BioLab to eventually get around the issue. I began the process with following the steps of the recipes I had found online but the variables involved were crazy. My first day of exploration, I placed the materials in the dehydrator to dry but they cracked. The obvious reason was because my recipe largely consisted of H2O. I began feeling a bit more confident after I made a material that seemed to hold its shape. But as the days passed, the material continued to shrink! I decided to experiment with the ratios and all the different materials I had used in the past recipes and create my own. It turned out quite nice as it was the most colourful, multi-textural and I found that I used the most avocado pit material in this one. It was great working along side by group in the BioLab as even though we were doing our own materials, we were very involved in the process of each-others. So I got more out of the exploration experience. I think I would like to work further on materials from kitchen waste but towards creating materials that are more thin, involve older techniques of making materials (less equipment and technology).

Where is the line between a child and a doll, between the animate and the inanimate, in other words, between life and death? - Gaby Wood We discussed the foundational understanding of AI(tools and ethics of it) and machine learning. We explored how one can construct applications to challenge these. Intelligence can be classified under some main categories like- a. Cultural Intelligence (storytelling & community) b. Emotional Intelligence c. Other SYMBOL: innate responses eg. a snake (a cat will interpret a cucumber as a snake) GOAL ORIENTED vs. JUST EXPERIENTIAL Intelligence: Specific functioning, symbol processing, information integration, motor complex skills & languages, etc. How do you define intelligence? SYMBOL GROUNDING PROBLEM (semiotics) how something is - how something connects or corresponds to it. Rational agent - will always choose the options by looking at the information it has, and the state it is in with its intelligence and choose which it can reach the goal faster. \"There is nothing as subjective as data\". How you measure, what you measure is a decision. Cluster - measure of similarity b/w objects Similarity - closer to which side? Centroid - center of a cluster Compulsive Intelligence - AI Confidence Threshold - at what % is it sure of a label. Eg. 80% person | 5% cat I felt as though this module would go over my head but the first few sessions around the theories helped me begin to understand these complex things from the ground-up. Everything was explained really well along with websites and artwork samples which were useful as at times the class felt quite intense. I really enjoyed how creative we got with selecting topics to work with for the AI neural net exercise. It felt very out-of-the-box and we just ran with this idea, and it paid off. We used this opportunity to mock certain companies that tries to sell gimmicky ideas at times. We really stepped into these shoes while making our whole presentation. I really enjoyed looking at all the different ways AI can be used, especially for art installations. Can AI tell us more than that which meets the eye? What if we could map more complex behaviours and interests concepts from a cultural perspective? That go beyond what it can see through images and hear (cause it\u2019s always listening).
